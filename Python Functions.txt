Functions
	def name_of_function():


Function 3 different types:
	**positional arguments: arguments that can be called by their position in the function definition
		def calculate_taxi_price(miles_to_travel, rate, discount):
	** Keyword arguments: where we explicitly refer to what each argument is assigned to in the function call.
		def calculate_taxi_price(rate=0.5, discount=10, miles_to_travel=100)
	** Default arguments: arguments that are given default values.


2 categoires of functions: 
	User defined function - functions that are written by users (like us!).
	Built-in function - come built into Python for us to use.
		https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

Return - When there is a result from a function that is stored in a variable, it is called a returned function value.
	Ability to Reuse function output with the return keyword, as well as multiple returns.

	current_budget = 3500.75
	shirt_expense = 9

	def print_remaining_budget(budget):
  	    print("Your remaining budget is: $" + str(budget))

	def deduct_expense(budget, expense):
  	    return budget - expense

	new_budget_after_shirt = deduct_expense(current_budget, shirt_expense)

	print_remaining_budget(new_budget_after_shirt)

  	   second = "Venice"
  	   third = "Florence"
  	   return first, second, third

	most_popular1, most_popular2, most_popular3 = top_tourist_locations_italy()

	print(most_popular1)
	print(most_popular2)
	print(most_popular3)

Remove Middle: All elements with an index between the starting and ending index should be removed from the list
	def remove_middle(lst, start, end):
   		return lst[:start] + lst[end+1:]

	print(remove_middle([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3))
